======
In this repository, we build mesh-based solutions (MBS) to total variation (TV) problems.

To run unit tests, we use the pytest module.

# Basics of Pytest

Install:

	pip install pytest


To run tests:

	py.test

runs unittest tests. Pytest by default searches for `*_test.py` or `test_*.py`.
